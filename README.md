Let's consider the graph below.

graph_image
Two possible representation of this graph are

the adjacency matrix

adj_mat =   [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
             [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
and the adjacency list

adj_list = [[1, 3], [2], [0], [4], [3], []]
implementing the convertion from the adjacency matrix to an adjacency list
